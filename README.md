### A simple cv2 blink detector that does not use imutils, idk why or who asked, but yeah here it is.

------
# What you need to know

* Written in Python 3.8.1
* Uses openCV v4.4.0
* Oh and I've set it to record only 40 frames at 10fps
* Run the mainframe.py file to use the gui

##### This removes any imutils dependencies that would otherwise be required and instead either rewrites it or I've written cv2 alternatives for them

######  Also thanks to Adrian Rosebrock from pyimagesearch for the face landmarks and tutorial UwU
